# Random Password

This is a beginner project [Random Password v1] that displays random password, developed with JavaScript and has a beautiful UI (if I do say so myself). I made this a year and some months ago. I decided to put it online and to not make it live locally anymore, it is something I find impressive till now and forever.
There exists a [version 2](https://github.com/contigen/Random-Password-Generator)
